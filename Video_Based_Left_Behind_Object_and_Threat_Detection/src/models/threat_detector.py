"""
Threat Detection Model - Pose-Based Approach

Detects threatening behavior using YOLOv8-pose keypoints + optical flow.
No external datasets or heavy frameworks required — works on CPU.

How it works
------------
1. YOLOv8n-pose detects people and their 17 COCO keypoints per frame.
2. Four heuristic scores are computed:
   - Proximity   : bounding-box overlap between any two people
   - Arm-raise   : wrists elevated above shoulder level (punching pose)
   - Motion      : dense optical flow magnitude in person regions
   - Fall        : unusually wide bounding box (person knocked down)
3. Scores are blended and smoothed over a short history window.
4. If smoothed confidence >= threshold -> threat alert.
